======== USERS ===============

A status field should be added for user activation and deactivation.
Possible statuses
0 - New user (needs supervisor activation to start using the system)
1 - Active user
3 - Deactivated user (user that no longer  has authorization to use the system)

                ###### ADDING A NEW USER ##############
    1. Any employee may create an account and go through the validation process
    2. After the employee creates the account, the record is added to the user table in the database
    3. The authorised flag in the database will be set to false (0)
    4. A supervisor will be notified of the added account for review
    5. Only after the account has been authorised, will the user be allowed to log in

            NB: Similarly a supervisor may deauthorise a user account at any time to prevent log in.



======= ADMIN PORTAL ==============

The admin portal should feature the following functions:

1. Activate/Deactivate user accounts
2. Add new users
    - Manually add a single user
    - Import multiple users using a CSV file
3. Reset users passwords
4. Access reports
